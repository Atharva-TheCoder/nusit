# NuSIT
**NuSIT** is a Nucleotide Sequence Identification Tool. This program is written in Python. It supports and works on almost every operating system. This program helps to identify whether the target nucleotide sequence is present in the main nucleotide sequence and the number of times the sequence is repeated. It also calculates the GC content in the given sequence. It shows results in seconds.

### Features

- Identifies target sequence in the main sequence
- Calculates GC content (in ratio and percent)
- Fast and reliable
- Easy to install
